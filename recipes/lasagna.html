    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In 2001, Regina Schrambling went on a week long odyssey in search of the best lasagna recipe. Her ideal here has an intensely flavored sauce, cheeses melted into creaminess as if they were bechamel, meat that’s just chunky enough and noodles that put up no resistance to the fork.</p>
  
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Lasagna noodles (about 9-12, depending on the size of your dish)</li>
        <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef or a mix of ground beef and Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cans (6 ounces each) tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup red wine (optional)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>Olive oil for cooking</li>
        <li>Cooking spray for the baking dish</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Cooking Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.</li>
      <li>Add the ground beef (or beef/sausage mix) to the skillet. Cook until browned, breaking it apart with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
      <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and red wine (if using). Add dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for about 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
      <li>In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with an egg, chopped parsley, and red pepper flakes (if using).</li>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>In a large baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top. Add half of the ricotta mixture, spreading it evenly. Sprinkle a layer of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the ricotta.</li>
      <li>Repeat the layers, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
      <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the edges are golden brown.</li>
      <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
